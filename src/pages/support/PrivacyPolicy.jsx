              4. THE PURPOSES AND GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING
            </h2>
            <p>
              We process personal data only to the extent necessary and
              appropriate for the specific processing purposes. Please note that
              one or more of the following purposes and legal grounds may apply
              simultaneously.
              <br />
              Firstly, fomino processes your personal data to perform our
              contractual obligations towards you or the Customer Organization,
              for example, to the extent necessary to:
              <br />
              offer the fomino Services to you under the contract between you
              and fomino or between Customer Organization and fomino or between
              fomino Drive customer and fomino;
              <br />
              perform the contract between you and fomino and for purposes of
              managing and delivering your Order as well as communicating with
              you about changes to terms and conditions, privacy policies, or
              other important changes related to the contract;
              <br />
              handle your payments or any refunds (where applicable) and to
              provide our partners (the restaurants, retailers and our courier
              partners hereinafter collectively also as “Partner”)) with the
              information necessary for the preparation or delivery of your
              order; and
              <br />
              to answer your questions or solve your support cases if you
              contact us.
              <br />
              Secondly, we may process your personal data if there is an
              appropriate and justifiable interest (that is, a legitimate
              interest) to run, maintain and develop our business or to create
              and maintain customer relationships. When choosing to use your
              data on the basis of our legitimate interests, we weigh our own
              interests against your right to privacy and, for example, provide
              you with easy to use opt-out from our marketing communications and
              use pseudonymized or non-personally identifiable data when
              possible. You have the right to object processing of your data on
              the basis of legitimate interest. However, fomino can refuse such
              an objection in accordance with applicable legislation, for
              example, if the processing is necessary for preparing, exercising
              or defending legal claims.
              <br />
              We process your personal data to the extent necessary and based on
              legitimate interest, for example, to:
              <br />
              claims handling, debt collection and legal processes. We may also
              process data for the prevention of fraud, misuse of our services
              and for information, system and network security and safety.
              <br />
              contact you regarding the fomino Services and to inform you of

              <br />
              Further, we may process your personal data to administer and
